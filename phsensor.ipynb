This storage medium will then be used to create a titration curve for the experiment. I have used a pandas user guide to aid in the progress of my project. The URL for this information is https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html. Information regarding the code for the sensor help was used from https://github.com/AtlasScientific/Raspberry-Pi-sample-code/blob/master/uart.py\n",

The progress I have made is the basic code for the axes with appropriate labels. The data values included are not the data points used in this experiment, but placeholders until data values are taken. The information and code was obtained from https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_labels.asp."
